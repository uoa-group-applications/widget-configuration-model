# Widget configuration model

The widget configuration model is a simple configuration protocol that is marshalled from and into using JSON.

The configuration protocol is used to communicate the abilities of a LMZ widget to the Adobe Experience Manager. AEM then uses this information to build new components and configuration dialogs.
